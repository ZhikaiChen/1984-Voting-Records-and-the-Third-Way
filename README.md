# 1984-Voting-Records-and-the-Third-Way
----
## Clustering
For this clustering exercise, I used a [voting dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/congressional+voting+records) from UCI Machine learning Repository.It contains 435 people and their views on 15 issues (yea/nay).
## Analysis
I discovered a group of democrats who were clustered together with most Republicans. From  their indexes, I inspected the top issues these democrats are most concerned with. These issues coincided with many of the campaign promises of Bill Clinton's 1992 run.
