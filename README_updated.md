# 1984-Voting-Records-and-the-Third-Way
---- 
This is a clustering project using [Congressional Voting Records Dataset ]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/congressional+voting+records])from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

I did a little analysis by comparing the labels the dataset originally contains with k-mean labels. The group of Democrats which are mislabelled by the k-mean algorithm as Republicans would be became a key voting block that propelled Bill Clinton to presidency.
